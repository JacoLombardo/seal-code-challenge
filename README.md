<h1>SEAL Code Challenge</h1>

  <p>I decided to use Next.js to develop this app since it's a framework that includes both frontend (React) and backend. As for the web services I decided to use the S3 bucket from AWS.<p>

<h2>Composition</h2>
  <p>The site is composed of:</p>
  <li>Upload, landing page to upload files;</li>
  <li>List, content page with all the files of the bucket.</li>
    
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p>The user is able to upload one or multiple files of type:</p>
  <li>PDF,</li>
  <li>Excel,</li>
  <li>Word,</li>
  <li>txt,</li>
  <li>images.</li>
  <p>The user is able to display a list of all the uploaded files, with different icons depending on the file type, and if they are images, also a preview.</p>
  <p>The user is able to download one or multiple files.</p>
  <p>The user is able to create a download link with expiration time (three options of expiration time) to share publicly.</p>
